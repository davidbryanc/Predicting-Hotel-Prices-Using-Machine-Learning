# Predicting Hotel Prices Using Machine Learning

## Description
Kyozo, a global hotel chain, seeks to develop a machine learning model to predict hotel prices for their new developments. As a data consultant, you are provided with a dataset from their existing hotels and tasked with creating a predictive model. The dataset includes various features and corresponding prices of thousands of Kyozo's current hotels.

## Background
Kyozo needs assistance in utilizing their dataset to make informed decisions on pricing for future hotels. This model will support Kyozo in expanding their business efficiently by setting competitive and profitable prices based on historical data.

## Task
Your task is to build a machine learning model that accurately predicts the prices of new hotels using the given dataset. The model should be able to generalize well to new data and provide reliable price estimates.

## Evaluation
The performance of the predictive model will be evaluated using Mean Absolute Error (MAE) on the target variable, which is the hotel price.

## Dataset
The dataset includes various features of existing hotels such as:
- Location
- Hotel star rating
- Number of rooms
- Amenities available
- Customer ratings
- Historical pricing information

## Result

Mean Absolute Error: 6914.9734
